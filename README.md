Python for Kids Learning Code

A friend of mine passed me this [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADX21Z6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ADX21Z6&linkCode=as2&tag=wilyansinncir-20) when I told her I want to pick up the Python programming language.

I found [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADX21Z6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ADX21Z6&linkCode=as2&tag=wilyansinncir-20) is very good way to pickup the language in an easy understood manner.

If you want to learn the python programming language or just want to get started in programming, this is a great book to get started.

My 2 cents for the author: if you can explain the coordinate of the graphic a bit better it would be great to following along.
