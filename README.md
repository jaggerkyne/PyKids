Python for Kids Learning Code

A friend of mine pass me this book[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADX21Z6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ADX21Z6&linkCode=as2&tag=wilyansinncir-20] when I told her I want to pick up the Python programming language.

I found this book is very good way to pickup the language in an easy understood manner.

If you want to learn the python programming language, this is a greatbook to get started.
